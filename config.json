Computer Architecture and Artificial Intelligence. \n              I did research in areas as diverse as distributed networks, robotics, molecular simulators, \n              and computation offloading to the cloud. My research also won awards at UROC from 2011-2013 \n              and I was a PURA award Recipient in 2012.","type":"textBlock"},{"images":[{"label":"The GT Night Rover team","imgPath":"https://farzon.org/imgs/gtnightrover.png"},{"label":"The 2011 UROC award winning poster","imgPath":"https://farzon.org/imgs/micrograph.png"},{"label":"The 2012 UROC award winning poster","imgPath":"https://farzon.org/imgs/lammps.png"},{"label":"The 2013 UROC award winning poster","imgPath":"https://farzon.org/imgs/offload.png"}],"type":"caurosel"},{"images":[{"label":"MeshMangle","imgPath":"https://farzon.org/imgs/intel/MeshMangle.png"},{"label":"MeshMangle Plain","imgPath":"https://farzon.org/imgs/intel/MeshManglePlain.png"},{"label":"MeshMangle With Deformation","imgPath":"https://farzon.org/imgs/intel/MeshMangleDeform.png"},{"label":"MeshMangle Tessellation Growth","imgPath":"https://farzon.org/imgs/intel/MeshMangleGrow.png"},{"label":"MeshPaint Plain","imgPath":"https://farzon.org/imgs/intel/meshPaintPlain.png"},{"label":"MeshPaint Painted","imgPath":"https://farzon.org/imgs/intel/meshPaintColored.png"},{"label":"Pop the bubbles game","imgPath":"https://farzon.org/imgs/intel/bubble.png"},{"label":"Camera Textured Cube, Rotated with Hand Gestures","imgPath":"https://farzon.org/imgs/intel/cube.png"},{"label":"Depth Camera with gesture recognition","imgPath":"https://farzon.org/imgs/intel/dephth1.png"},{"label":"Color Interpolation & Audio augmentation using hand gestures","imgPath":"https://farzon.org/imgs/intel/perceptualGesture.png"},{"label":"MIDI piano controls using hand gestures","imgPath":"https://farzon.org/imgs/intel/piano.png"}],"type":"caurosel"},{"description":"The Intel competition led to two internships with Intel where \n                            I worked on natural user interfaces the first year and on video \n                            compressions algorithms the second year.","type":"textBlock"},{"description":"After graduation I joined Microsoft on a then \n              secret project today known as the Edge browser. I worked to improve the performance \n              of their JavaScript compiler while also bringing it into compliance with the ecmascript 6 \n              standard. The release of Windows 10 was a monumental achievement for me and my team. \n              For the first time Microsoft shipped a browser that had a faster and more standard \n              compliant JavaScript compiler than Google, Mozilla, and Apple. I then worked on an \n              extensive effort to open source and port our compiler to Linux and OS X. The project can \n              be found on Github at Microsoft/Chakracore.","type":"textBlock"},{"description":" I left Microsoft to work at a Startup (Ionic Security). The company is \n              primarily an endpoint encryption platform. On my first team we focus on file encryption, \n              where I built out an  IRM (Information Rights Management) and analytics strategy for them. \n              I reverse engineered closed source productivity applications to inject code into a process for\n              analysis and controlling the flow of data between apps, printers, and users. Later\n              I transitioned to work on their sdk team where I was instrumental in the creation of a \n              native java and javascript sdk while also adding many features to their c++ sdk such as \n              an extensible offline key vault api.","type":"textBlock"},{"description":" I am now a Graduate Research engineer in the HParch \n              lab at Gatech where I do research in computer architecture so that I can pursue a masters \n              degree in my new passion computer graphics.","type":"textBlock"}],"type":"horizontalScroller","orientation":"top"},{"type":"collection","barId":"Papers","name":"Techincal Papers","description":"Here are some featured technical papers of mine","orientation":"bottom","item":[{"name":"Analysis of Offloading","url":"https://farzon.org/files/papers/CS6250_Final_Paper.pdf","description":"A testing framework to measure the practicality of offloading ML, AR, CV, & image processing jobs to a remote server.","tag":"Networking"},{"name":"Edge-spiral morphs between Quads","url":"https://farzon.org/files/papers/CS6491_P1.pdf","description":"A project where we produce a Spiral Edge Morph using the SQUINT method.","tag":"Graphics"},{"name":"Image warping using a SQUINT grid of tiles","url":"https://farzon.org/files/papers/CS6491_P2.pdf","description":"A project where we developed a quad mesh using SQUINT Maps for texture mapping and image warping.","tag":"Graphics"},{"name":"Recursive SQUINT on Neville & Bezier Curves","url":"https://farzon.org/files/papers/CS6491_P3.pdf","description":"A project where we recrusively warped SQUINT maps along paths generated using Neville and Bezier curves.","tag":"Graphics"},{"name":"Lets get Twisty","url":"https://farzon.org/files/papers/CS6491_Project_2.pdf","description":"A project where we explored different techniques for twisting 3D tori.","tag":"Graphics"},{"name":"Volume displacement through two pillars","url":"https://farzon.org/files/papers/CS6491_Project_3.pdf","description":"To re-distribute mass of the worm both vertically and horizontally.","tag":"Graphics"}]},{"type":"collection","barId":"Posters","name":"Techincal Posters","description":"Here are some featured technical Posters of mine","orientation":"bottom","item":[{"name":"An Infrastructure for Transient Networks","url":"https://farzon.org/files/posters/Micrograph_V3.pdf","description":"A proximity based p2p network.
